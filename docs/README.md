#TypeScript, Angular 6 expert skilled in BDD/TDD, E2E- and unit-testing  
  
Good day, dear customer!  
Let me ask you three questions:  
  
- Would you like to get the high quality code?  
- Do you need the easy to support and bugs free code?  
- Do you want not only peace of the code but complete solution of your tasks?  
  
If all your answers are «yes» you came to the right person because since 1986 
I have over 25 years of IT-experience. I have had Microsoft Certified Trained status 
so I know what to do to get the jobs well done. And I have been working in web-development 
for 12 years. Last 5 years I specialising in frond-end development because I like JavaScript. 
I believe it is a language of the future.  
  
I write the code quickly because I use Angular framework and I love it.
My code almost bugs free because I use testing systems like QUnit and Jasmine.
It is well structured, commented, easy to maintain and develop because of JsLint,JsHint,ESLint tools.
It could not be conflicted with your existing site or code because I always use strict mode and classes. Also I never use global space for local variables :)
  
My other skills are:  
- TypeScript, JavaScript, Angular, AngularJS, ES5, ES6, ES2015, ES2017 are for front-end development  
- Express.js, Node.js, LoopBack, Swagger, MySql, MongoDB, MEAN.js are for back-end development  
- Git / Git Flow / Bitbucket / GitHub are for code collaboration  
- JSLint / JSHint / ESLint are for code quality  
- JSTestDriver / Karma / Wallaby.js are test runners  
- Cucumber.js, Jasmine.js and Serenity-js are for BDD (behaviour driven development)  
- QUnit is a assertion framework for unit tests and TDD (test driven development)  
- Sinon.JS is for API testing  
- Istanbul coverage tool  
- Protractor, Jasmine, Selenium WebDriver, Sauce Labs - for end-to-end code testing  
- jspm, npm, bower, yarn for packaging  
- Grunt / Gulp Task Runners  
- requirejs, browserify, chai and many other JS libraries and utilities  
- RESTful web services (JSON APIs, etc)  
- social network's APIs (facebook, twitter)  
I like to use Scrum / Agile methodology.  
  
Summing up, we must do the right things the right way, don't we?  
  
Typically, the work process I prefer to looks like the follow:  
1) I write the scenario using Gherkin Given-When-Then notation for the new feature and confirm it with you. It can look like this:  
```Gherkin  
Given the user opens homepage  
When the user clicks "agree" checkbox  
Then the user should not see the EULA anymore  
Scenario lets us be sure that we are doing the right things.  
```  
2) Then I create end-to-end tests for the scenario and write unit test for the future code. After that, we are sure that we are doing the things right.  
3) Then I write the code. Usually, every commit goes through e2e- and unit-tests and code quality checks (Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery workflow). This allows us to be sure that the code is reliable, extensible and will not contain any errors even in the future.
